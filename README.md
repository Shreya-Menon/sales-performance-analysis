## Project Title

Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI

## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to perform an end-to-end data analysis on sales data to uncover meaningful business insights related to sales performance, profitability, customer segments, and discount strategies, and to present these insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives of the Project

The key objectives of this project are:
-> To clean and preprocess raw sales data for accurate analysis
-> To analyze sales and profit trends using Python-based data analysis techniques
-> To perform structured business analysis using SQL queries using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin
-> To identify key revenue drivers and loss-making areas
-> To study the impact of discounts on profitability
-> To build an interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard
-> To present insights and business recommendations clearly for stakeholders

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is a public sales dataset containing order-level information.
Columns Present in the Dataset:
-> Ship Mode
-> Segment
-> Country
-> City
-> State
-> Postal Code
-> Region
-> Category
-> Sub-Category
-> Sales
-> Quantity
-> Discount
-> Profit
The dataset includes transactional sales data across different regions, customer segments, and product categories.

## Tools & Technologies Used

-> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-> SQL (Data analysis and business queries using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin)
-> Power BI Desktop (Dashboard creation and visualization)
-> Jupyter Notebook (Python analysis environment)

## Project Workflow

The project follows a complete end-to-end data analytics pipeline:
1. Data collection and understanding
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
4. Business analysis using SQL
5. Data visualization and dashboard creation using Power BI
6. Insight generation and business recommendations

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data cleaning was performed using Python to ensure accuracy and consistency in analysis. The following steps were carried out:
1. Converted relevant columns into appropriate data types
2. Checked for missing values and removed incomplete records
3. Removed duplicate records to avoid biased analysis
4. Validated numerical columns such as Sales, Profit, and Discount
5. Exported a cleaned dataset for further SQL and Power BI analysis
   
This step ensured that the dataset was reliable and ready for downstream analytics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python

Python libraries were used to perform detailed exploratory data analysis.
Key Analyses Performed:
-> Overall sales and profit overview
-> Sales distribution across product categories
-> Profitability analysis across regions
-> Customer segment-wise sales analysis
-> Identification of seasonal and trend-based patterns
-> Analysis of loss-making sub-categories
   
Visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots were created to understand patterns and relationships within the data.

## Key Insights from Python Analysis

1. Technology category contributes the highest share of total sales
2. Certain regions consistently underperform in terms of profitability
3. High discounts are strongly associated with negative profits
4. Some product sub-categories generate losses despite high sales volume
5. Central region needs attention

## SQL-Based Business Analysis

After cleaning the data, SQL was used to perform structured and business-oriented analysis.
SQL Analysis Included:
1. Total sales and profit calculations
2. Category-wise and region-wise sales analysis
3. Segment-wise revenue contribution
4. Identification of loss-making sub-categories
5. Discount impact analysis on profitability
6. Shipping mode profitability analysis
7. Ranking and aggregation using advanced SQL queries

SQL queries enabled efficient data aggregation and validation of insights derived from Python analysis.

## Key Insights from SQL Analysis

1. Technology products are the primary revenue drivers
2. Certain regions show persistent losses and require strategic intervention
3. Sub-categories such as Tables and Bookcases consistently incur losses
4. Orders with higher discount rates frequently result in negative profit
5. Standard shipping mode is more cost-effective compared to other modes

## Power BI Dashboard Development

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop to build an interactive dashboard.
Dashboard Structure:
The Power BI report consists of three pages, each focusing on different analytical perspectives.

Page 1: Sales Overview Dashboard
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin
Sales distribution across categories and segments
High-level business performance overview

Page 2: Profitability & Discount Analysis
Region-wise profit analysis
Discount vs profit relationship analysis
Identification of loss-making product sub-categories
Visual representation of discount impact on profitability

Page 3: Operational & Shipping Analysis
Profitability by shipping mode
Segment-wise performance breakdown
Interactive filters for region, category, segment, and ship mode
Slicers were added to allow users to dynamically filter data and explore insights interactively.

## Key Insights from Power BI Dashboard

-> Technology category consistently outperforms other categories in revenue
-> Central region requires strategic improvements to improve profitability
-> Excessive discounting significantly impacts overall profit margins
-> Certain product sub-categories need pricing or cost restructuring
-> Shipping mode optimization can improve profit efficiency

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
-> Optimize discount strategies, especially for loss-making products
-> Focus marketing and sales efforts on high-margin product categories
-> Review pricing and operational costs in underperforming regions
-> Reassess product sub-categories that consistently incur losses
-> Improve logistics planning by promoting cost-effective shipping modes

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data processing to actionable business insights. By combining Python, SQL, and Power BI, the project highlights the ability to analyze complex datasets, validate insights across tools, and communicate results effectively through interactive dashboards.

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making and reflects industry-standard practices followed by professional data analysts.

## Future Enhancements

-> Integration of time-based analysis for trend forecasting
-> Addition of predictive models for sales forecasting
-> Automation of data refresh in Power BI
-> Expansion of analysis using customer-level data
-> Advanced DAX measures for deeper insights

This project serves as a strong demonstration of:
- Data cleaning and preparation skills
- Analytical thinking and business understanding
- Proficiency in Python, SQL, and Power BI
- Ability to communicate insights clearly and effectively
